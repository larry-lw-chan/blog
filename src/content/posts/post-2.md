After geeking about Astro, I decided to try and see if I can get Astro local build running on my machine.  First things first, I assume the readers here all meet the prerequistes.  

### Prerequistes
- **[Node.js](https://https://nodejs.org/en)** - v18.14.1 or higher.
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - VS Code has an Astro extension available.
- **[Terminal](#)** - Astro is accessed through its command-line interface (CLI).

### Here's the NPM commands to install Astro
Assuming you got all the prerequites installed, here's what you need to type into the terminal

```bash
npm create astro@latest
npm run dev
```

Wow, that was an easy install!  Even easier than setting up a LAMP enviroment for Wordpress.
